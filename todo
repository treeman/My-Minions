Sounds:
    Intersection sounds for 2, 3 and 4 charges
    *Simple turn
    *Split sound, T intersection
    *Hit a dead end
    *Initiate charge sound

    *At least 5 different sound objects to place
    *    (drums or whatever, so we can make something fun out of this)

Core engine:
    *2 types of charges (0 and 1)
    Detect intersections
    *Universal time for charge travel
    *    Pause/Unpause and set the speed
    *    Need visual? At least a marker or something
    *Objects
        *Objects for different sounds
        *Need visual
        *AND, OR, NOT gates
        NAND, NOR, XOR later too?
        *Rotate rotateable objects
        *Delete objects, then delete path
        *Global charge kill switch
        *Kill individual charges

    Intro/Narrative/Tutorial stuff

Graphics:
    *Paths, graphics for all objects
    Graphics for intro

Later on, only when we've got the time:
    *Save and Load maps (with menu or something)
        Don't have a menu and it can only save or load one specific map at a time
        You'll have to move around it manually if you want to keep it
    Infinitive map which generates the more you move around
