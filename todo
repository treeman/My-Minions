Sounds:
    Intersection sounds for 2, 3 and 4 charges
    *Simple turn
    *Split sound, T intersection
    *Hit a dead end
    *Initiate charge sound

    *At least 5 different sound objects to place
    *    (drums or whatever, so we can make something fun out of this)

Core engine:
    *2 types of charges (0 and 1)
    Detect intersections
    *Universal time for charge travel
    *    Pause/Unpause and set the speed
        Need visual? At least a marker or something
    *Objects
        *Objects for different sounds
        Need visual
        AND, OR, NOT gates
            *AND, OR, NOT done
            *Need to connect with several entrances
            *And it needs to interact with path
            possibly NAND, NOR, XOR later too?
            If I really really have time, add more complex stuff
        Rotate rotateable objects
            (dunno if we need all possible combinations of ports though)
        *Delete objects, then delete path
        Global charge kill switch
        *Kill individual charges

    Intro/Narrative/Tutorial stuff

Graphics:
    Paths, graphics for all objects
    Graphics for intro

Later on, only when we've got the time:
    Save and Load maps (with menu or something)
    Infinitive map which generates the more you move around
