Here's a wacky idea.

Alien father:
    You are the last of our species, but you must survive!
    Now go, off this planet before it's too late.
    But it's dangerous outside. Here, take this!

You:
    But what is this?

Father:
    I'ts a Chaos-to-Order beam!

You:
    Oooooh...
    ...
    But what does it do?

Father:
    You will bring order into the desolate planets that exist out there,
    and you can send your minions down to work for you.
    But remember, they need order first.

    Now go!

*Enters orbit around a desolate unknown planet*
Narrator:
    Disaster occurs, you're stuck in your frozen spacecraft!
    Now your only hope is to use the Chaos-to-Order beam!

Or something similar. Lol.
