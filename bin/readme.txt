This is my little entry for Ludum Dare 20.

The game doesn't really have a goal, build pathways for your minions to walk and
make them play sounds. Use the power of digital circuits and create something fun.

There's some wacky keybindings for this one:

    Place an object                 Mouse Left
    Toggle up through objects       1
    Toggle down through objects     2
    Release a minion                Space
    Kill all minions                K

    Pause                           P
    Increase speed                  Left Shift
    Decrease speed                  Left Ctrl

    Load map                        L
    Save map                        S

    Console, nothin fun :(          F1
    Exit the game                   F10

Now beware, I didn't have the time or energy to create a full blown level saving,
so it will always use "level.dat" in bin as it's save file. It will overwrite and
it will do so without asking.

Use at your own risk :)

Also I had this fantastic bind in with the theme, that you were supposed to be an
alien from a distant planet but you got stuck in the earths orbit and now you must
use your minions to build something to help you.

But alas it was not to be...

It was meant to be a very different game actually, but no matter. It was fun!

I might develop it more later on when I have time, it's promising but it needs a lot
more polish and control over things.

If you want to build it yourself here's the source:

Dependencies are sfml, boost, lua.

And finally if you liked it, or if you have tips or things you're missing then
